                        <h3>Crypto Mining & Blockchain Node</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project was driven by my interest in learning how blockchain validation nodes operate and how miners get rewarded for verifying transactions and mined blocks. To explore this, I set up 11 mini PCs as blockchain nodes, each with its own wallet, and purchased an IceRiver KS0 Pro miner to gain hands-on experience with cryptocurrency mining and automation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The blockchain nodes validate transactions, contributing to network security and decentralization while earning potential rewards for verifying legitimate blocks. Meanwhile, the IceRiver KS0 Pro miner operates autonomously, mining cryptocurrency with minimal manual intervention.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Managing multiple wallets across 11 nodes quickly became inefficient, so I developed an automated transfer script to consolidate all earnings from 10 wallets into a single main wallet. This script ensures seamless fund management, reduces manual oversight, and optimizes the mining operation. With everything automated, I can focus on improving efficiency and monitoring the network without manually handling transactions.
