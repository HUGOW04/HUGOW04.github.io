                            This is an automated tool designed to track cryptocurrency prices in real-time. It fetches the latest price for a specified currency, such as Bitcoin, and checks for specific milestones based on the set threshold.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tracker compares the current price with pre-defined milestones, sending instant notifications when a new milestone is reached. Notifications are sent via a Discord webhook, including the current price and milestone information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This tool is ideal for traders or enthusiasts who want to stay updated on key price movements without constantly monitoring the market. It runs automatically in the background, ensuring that you never miss a significant price change.
