                        <h3>Trade Bot</h3>
                        <p>
                            This C++ powered trading bot automates trading based on real-time indicator data. It uses APIs to open long and short positions in cryptocurrency markets, ensuring quick and accurate execution of trades.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, the bot sends real-time notifications through a Discord webhook whenever a position is opened (long/short) and reports on whether the trade succeeded or failed. This allows you to quickly debug and fix any errors, optimizing the bot's performance and reliability.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The bot integrates with popular crypto platforms like PancakeSwap and Uniswap, providing a seamless, automated trading experience. With the help of C++ and OpenGL, the program remains fast, efficient, and cross-platform compatible (Windows, macOS, Linux).
