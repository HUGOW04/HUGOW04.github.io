                        <h3>Automated News Fetcher</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project is an automated bot designed to fetch and filter interesting news articles, delivering real-time updates through a Discord webhook. The bot scrapes multiple sources, analyzes trending topics, and posts only the most relevant and engaging news to keep users informed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The system runs 24/7, continuously monitoring news sources. However, it only sends an alert at 12 AM each day, ensuring that I receive a summarized list of the latest articles. The alert appears in a Discord channel, allowing me to scroll through the headlines and click on a link to read the full article if something catches my attention.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By integrating automation and filtering logic, the bot ensures that only high-quality and relevant articles are shared. This makes it an efficient tool for staying informed without information overload.
