                            This is a tool that automatically tracks airdrops for you. It first checks your Solana wallet for any current airdrops and waits for a new airdrop to show up. When it detects one, it sends you an instant notification.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The notifications sent to your Discord include important details, such as your wallet balance, wallet address, and the mint address. This helps you easily keep track of the latest airdrops and manage your wallet without having to check manually.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The bot works continuously in the background, making sure you never miss out on any new airdrop opportunities. Itâ€™s a fast and efficient way to stay updated on airdrop events.
