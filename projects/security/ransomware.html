                <h3>Ransomware</h3>
                <p>
                    This C++ program demonstrates ransomware functionality, designed to encrypt files on a Windows system 
                    and demand a ransom for decryption. The application encrypts files using a custom encryption algorithm 
                    and provides a method for decryption. Itâ€™s intended for educational purposes only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Key Features:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>File Encryption:</strong> Encrypts files using a custom algorithm to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li><strong>File Decryption:</strong> Provides a method to decrypt files with the corresponding decryption key.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Avoids encrypting critical system directories to prevent system damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Progress Reporting:</strong> Outputs status updates on file encryption and decryption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Windows API Integration:</strong> Utilizes Win32 API for file operations and system interactions.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How It Works:</h4>
                <p>
                    The ransomware encrypts files in user directories by reading and modifying them in blocks. Encrypted files 
                    are appended with a `.tu` extension. The decryption process reverses the encryption, restoring files to their 
                    original state using the decryption key. Critical system files and directories are excluded from encryption.
                </p>
                <h4>Installation and Usage:</h4>
                <p>
                    Compile the C++ source code in a Windows environment and run the executable. Use the ransomware in a 
                    controlled, educational setting. Encrypted files will have a `.tu` extension; use the decryption tool to 
                    restore them. Ensure the ransomware is used responsibly to avoid unintended consequences.
