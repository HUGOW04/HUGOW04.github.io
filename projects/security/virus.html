                            This C++ application is a malicious program designed to disrupt a Windows system by attempting to overwrite 
                            the Master Boot Record (MBR). Specifically, the program fills the MBR with zeros, which results in the 
                            operating system being unable to locate the MBR during the startup process. This action effectively 
                            renders the system unbootable, as Windows cannot find the necessary boot information to start the OS. 
                            Additionally, the program creates graphical and auditory disturbances to further disrupt the user experience. 
                            It starts by hiding the console window, then overwrites the MBR, displays a warning message, and enters 
                            an infinite loop to change desktop colors, draw shapes, and generate beeping sounds, causing confusion and frustration.
