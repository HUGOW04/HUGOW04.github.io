                <p>
                    This C++ application is a malicious program designed to cause significant disruptions on a Windows system. 
                    It attempts to overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR), which can make the system unbootable. Additionally, 
                    the program creates various graphical and auditory disturbances to further disrupt the user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Key Features:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MBR Overwrite:</strong> Attempts to overwrite the Master Boot Record of the system's primary drive, potentially rendering the system unbootable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Warning Message:</strong> Displays a message box to warn the user about the infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Graphical Disturbances:</strong> Randomly changes desktop colors, draws lines and shapes, and creates visual noise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Auditory Disturbances:</strong> Generates random beeps to further disrupt the user experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How It Works:</h4>
                <p>
                    The application starts by hiding the console window to avoid user interaction. It then attempts to overwrite 
                    the Master Boot Record of the primary drive, which can make the system unbootable. After that, it displays a 
                    warning message to the user. The program then enters an infinite loop where it creates various visual and 
                    auditory disturbances on the desktop, such as changing colors, drawing shapes, and generating beeps. These 
                    actions are intended to cause confusion and frustration.
                </p>
                <h4>Installation and Usage:</h4>
                <p>
                    Compile the C++ source code in a Windows environment and run the executable to start the malicious program. 
                    Be aware that running this program will cause significant disruption to your system and is intended for 
                    demonstration purposes only. Use this code responsibly and only in a controlled environment where you have 
                    permission to test such software.
