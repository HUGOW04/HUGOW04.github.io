                <h3>TuAntiVirus</h3>
                <p>
                    TuAntiVirus is a Windows-based antivirus application designed to detect and manage malware threats. 
                    Developed using C++ and the Win32 API, this application offers both file-specific and full system 
                    scanning capabilities. It utilizes MD5 hashing to compare files against known malware signatures 
                    and provides a user-friendly interface for easy operation and result tracking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Key Features:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>File Scanning:</strong> Select and scan individual files for known malware using MD5 hashes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Full System Scan:</strong> Recursively scans all files in a specified directory for malware.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Status Updates:</strong> Displays current scan status and results directly in the user interface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Results Management:</strong> Logs scanning results to a text file and allows users to view results directly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Windows API Integration:</strong> Utilizes Win32 API for window management and user interactions.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How It Works:</h4>
                <p>
                    The application uses MD5 hashing to identify malware. When a file is scanned, its MD5 hash is compared 
                    against a list of known malware hashes stored in a text file. The application updates the user interface 
                    with the scan results, indicating whether the file is infected or clean. For a full system scan, 
                    the application iterates through all files in the specified directory, applying the same hash comparison 
                    and updating the results accordingly.
                </p>
                <h4>Installation and Usage:</h4>
                <p>
                    To use TuAntiVirus, compile the C++ source code in a Windows environment and run the executable. 
                    Use the provided buttons to initiate file scans, perform full system scans, and view results. 
                    Ensure that the `hashcodes.txt` file is correctly populated with known malware hashes for accurate scanning.
