                        <h3>Cross-Platform AntiVirus</h3>
                        <p>
                            This version of the AntiVirus project is an improved version of my previous antivirus application. It is a cross-platform tool developed in C++ with OpenGL for rendering, ensuring compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The application efficiently detects and manages malware threats, offering file-specific and full system scanning features. Unlike my previous version, this iteration uses the more secure SHA-256 hashing algorithm instead of MD5 to compare files against known malware signatures, providing enhanced security through modern cryptographic methods. The user interface, rendered with OpenGL, guarantees a responsive and consistent experience across all platforms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The application allows users to scan individual files or perform full system scans, recursively analyzing files within specified directories. During scanning, real-time updates provide the status of the operation, and results are logged to a text file for easy access. This ensures users are always informed about the progress of the scan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This AntiVirus tool uses SHA-256 hashing to generate a unique hash for each scanned file, which is then compared with a database of known malware hashes. This approach ensures reliable detection of malicious files. For full system scans, the process is applied recursively across all files, providing real-time feedback on detected threats.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's important to note that this version is a simple malware scanner that compares files with a database of known malware hashes. While it is a step forward in security, there are many features I plan to add in the future to enhance its capabilities and make it more comprehensive.
                        </p>
