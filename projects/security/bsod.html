                        <p>
                            This C++ application is designed to trigger a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) on a Windows system. By leveraging 
                            low-level NT API functions, the program induces a critical system error that leads the operating system to 
                            crash, resulting in the display of a BSoD. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The application first elevates its process privileges to allow for system-level shutdown operations. Once it 
                            has the necessary permissions, it calls the `NtRaiseHardError` function with a specific error status. This 
                            function simulates a severe error condition that the Windows operating system cannot recover from. The 
                            result is a complete system halt, and the BSoD is displayed, typically accompanied by an error message 
                            indicating the nature of the issue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This application is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating the impact of critical system errors 
                            and the underlying mechanics of how the Windows operating system handles such failures. It should only be 
                            executed in a controlled environment, as triggering a BSoD will result in a complete system crash and may 
                            lead to data loss.
