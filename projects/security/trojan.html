                <h3>Trojan Horse</h3>
                <p>
                    This C++ application is a Trojan horse, a type of malicious software that disguises itself as legitimate 
                    software to gain access to a user's system. Once executed, it performs a variety of harmful activities 
                    without the user's consent, such as remote control, file manipulation, and data collection. 
                    The Trojan can connect to a command-line interface, manage files, capture user data, and disrupt system 
                    operations, all while hiding its presence to avoid detection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon execution, the Trojan horse conceals the console window to evade user awareness. It establishes a 
                    connection to a remote server or command center to receive and execute commands. The application can 
                    perform a range of actions including file management, keystroke logging, taking screenshots, and extracting 
                    sensitive browser data. Its deceptive nature makes it a significant threat, emphasizing the importance of 
                    cybersecurity awareness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compile the C++ source code in a Windows environment and run the executable to start the Trojan horse. 
                    This application is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the capabilities and risks of such 
                    malicious software. Use it responsibly and only in a controlled environment where you have explicit permission 
                    to test and analyze such tools.
