                <p>
                    This C++ application simulates a phishing website designed for educational purposes, showcasing how attackers can capture login credentials from unsuspecting users. The server hosts a fake login page that closely mimics legitimate sites, tricking users into entering their usernames and passwords. Once captured, these credentials are sent to an attacker-controlled server for unauthorized access.

                    The application features a convincing fake login page, designed to look like a familiar website's login interface. It operates as a basic HTTP server, serving the login page and handling incoming HTTP requests. The phishing mechanism employs JavaScript to transmit the entered credentials to the attacker's server while serving static files from a specified directory. This application aims to educate users about phishing techniques and enhance security awareness.

                <p>
                    The phishing website operates by setting up a simple HTTP server that serves a login page from a predetermined directory. Users are presented with a form to enter their credentials, which, upon submission, are sent to the attacker's remote server. This demonstration serves as a crucial learning tool for understanding how phishing attacks function and developing strategies to defend against them.
