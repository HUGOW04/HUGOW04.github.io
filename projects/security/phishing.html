                        <h3>Phishing Demonstration</h3>
                        <p>
                            This C++ application demonstrates a phishing attack, using an ESP32 device to simulate a fake login page. The attack begins when the ESP32 creates a rogue Wi-Fi network called <strong>TUC Yrkesh√∂gskola</strong>, which unsuspecting users might connect to, thinking it is a legitimate access point. Once connected, users are redirected to a counterfeit login page resembling a real institutional website, such as a student portal or email login page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fake login page closely mimics the legitimate website's design, including form fields for email and password. When users attempt to log in, their credentials (email and Gmail password) are captured without their knowledge. After the user submits their login details, they will see a loading screen or some other form of a "fake" action indicating that the login is processing. However, nothing will actually happen on the webpage. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In reality, the ESP32 device silently captures the entered credentials, which can then be sent to the attacker. This simulation provides a clear example of how phishing attacks work, allowing users to understand the potential risks associated with connecting to unsecured or rogue Wi-Fi networks and the importance of verifying the authenticity of login pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This demonstration is a valuable tool for educational purposes, helping users recognize phishing attempts and the importance of maintaining security awareness online. By learning how these attacks are carried out, individuals can better defend themselves against similar threats in the real world.
