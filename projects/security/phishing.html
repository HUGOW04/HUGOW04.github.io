                <h3>Phishing Website</h3>
                <p>
                    This C++ application simulates a phishing website designed to capture login credentials from unsuspecting users. 
                    The server hosts a fake login page that mimics legitimate sites to trick users into entering their usernames and 
                    passwords. The captured credentials are then sent to the attacker for unauthorized access.

                <p>
                    <strong>Key Features:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fake Login Page:</strong> Presents a login form that looks like a legitimate website's login page.</li>
                    <li><strong>HTTP Server:</strong> Hosts the login page and handles incoming HTTP requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credential Capture:</strong> Uses JavaScript to send login credentials to the attacker's server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Static File Serving:</strong> Serves the phishing page and associated files from a specified directory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Educational Use:</strong> Demonstrates phishing techniques for security training and awareness.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How It Works:</h4>
                <p>
                    The application sets up a basic HTTP server that serves a login page from a predefined directory. The HTML page 
                    contains a form where users enter their credentials. When the form is submitted, JavaScript sends the entered 
                    data to a remote server controlled by the attacker. This setup is used for educational purposes to show how phishing 
                    attacks work and to help in developing defenses against them.
                </p>
                <h4>Installation and Usage:</h4>
                <p>
                    Compile the C++ source code in a Windows environment and run the executable to start the phishing server. 
                    Place the phishing HTML page and associated files in the specified directory. Open the server in a browser and 
                    simulate user login to capture credentials. Use this setup responsibly and only in a controlled, educational environment.
