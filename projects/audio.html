                    <h3>CS:GO Aimbot</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project involves the development of a custom aimbot for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). The aimbot calculates the vector from the player's gun to the enemy players by reading memory values and precisely adjusts the crosshair to aim at the enemy when the gun is fired.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aimbot integrates deeply with the game's memory to ensure accuracy and speed, giving the player a significant edge in targeting enemies. It demonstrates advanced memory manipulation, vector calculations, and real-time input handling.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Memory Reading:</strong> Accesses and reads enemy player positions directly from the game's memory.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vector Calculation:</strong> Calculates the precise vector from the player's gun to the target for accurate aiming.</li>
                        <li><strong>Real-time Input Handling:</strong> Moves the cursor in real-time to align with the calculated aim vector when firing.</li>
                        <li><strong>High Accuracy:</strong> Ensures precise aiming for effective targeting in competitive gameplay.</li>

                    <h3>Memory Manipulation Tool</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project features the development of a custom Cheat Engine designed for reading and writing memory within running processes. The tool is capable of scanning a process by its Process ID (PID) to search for specific memory addresses and allows users to modify those memory values directly. This enables various manipulations, such as altering in-game resources, changing player stats, or bypassing restrictions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The engine is built to interact with system memory at a low level, providing powerful and precise control over the target process. It is useful for both educational purposes in understanding memory management and for creating custom mods or cheats in gaming environments.
