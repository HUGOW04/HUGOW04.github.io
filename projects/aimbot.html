                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This project involves the development of an aimbot specifically designed for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO). The aimbot enhances the player's accuracy by automatically adjusting aim towards opponents, improving the chances of hitting targets. It analyzes player and enemy positions in real-time for precise aim adjustments without manual input.
                </p>

                <h2>Code Explanation</h2>
                <p>
                    The aimbot is implemented in C++ and reads the game's memory to obtain data about player and enemy locations. It calculates angles required to aim at opponents and adjusts the player's view angles automatically, enhancing shooting efficiency and accuracy during gameplay.
                </p>

                <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                <p>
                    Using C++ for direct memory manipulation, the project accesses critical in-game data for dynamic aim adjustments. The system is designed for speed and precision, providing a clear example of low-level memory handling and real-time data processing.
                </p>

                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    While this project demonstrates advanced programming skills, using aimbots in online games is unethical and violates terms of service, potentially leading to account bans or legal issues. This project is strictly for educational purposes and should only be used in controlled environments where permission has been granted.
