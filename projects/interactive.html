                    <h3>CS:GO Aimbot</h3>
                    <p>A custom-built aimbot for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) developed in C++. This tool enhances aiming accuracy by automatically adjusting the player's aim towards opponents. It reads game memory to calculate optimal aiming angles and adjusts the player's view accordingly.</p>

                    <h3>Cheat Engine</h3>
                    <p>A C++ program designed to manipulate the memory of running processes on a Windows system, allowing users to change the game state or modify variables. This tool is typically used for debugging and educational purposes to understand how programs operate at a low level.</p>

                    <h3>Hex Editor</h3>
                    <p>This project involves developing a Hex Editor, a tool that allows users to view and edit the raw binary data of files. Unlike standard text editors, a Hex Editor displays data in hexadecimal format, which is essential for tasks such as debugging, reverse engineering, and detailed file analysis. Key features include dual-mode viewing (hexadecimal and ASCII), direct binary data editing, and advanced navigation controls.</p>

                    <h3>Input Overlay</h3>
                    <p>This project involves creating an input overlay application that visually displays the status of keyboard and mouse inputs. The tool provides a graphical representation of key presses and mouse button states in real-time, useful for debugging and stream overlays.</p>

                    <h3>DLL Injection</h3>
                    <p>This project involves creating a DLL injection application that injects a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process. The tool allows users to select a DLL file and inject it into a target process, where the DLL's code can then be executed. This technique is often used for various purposes, including debugging, extending functionality, or modifying the behavior of applications.</p>
