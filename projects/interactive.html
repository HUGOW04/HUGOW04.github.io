                    <h3>CS:GO Aimbot</h3>
                    <p>A custom-built aimbot for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) developed in C++. This tool enhances aiming accuracy by automatically adjusting the player's aim towards opponents. It reads game memory to calculate optimal aiming angles and adjusts the player's view accordingly.</p>

                    <h3>Cheat Engine</h3>
                    <p>A C++ program designed to encrypt files on a Windows system, making them inaccessible until a decryption key is provided. The program uses a custom encryption algorithm and appends a `.tu` extension to encrypted files. It demonstrates ransomware functionality for educational purposes only.</p>

                    <h3>Hex Editor</h3>
                    <p>This project involves developing a Hex Editor, a tool that allows users to view and edit the raw binary data of files. Unlike standard text editors, a Hex Editor displays data in hexadecimal format, which is essential for tasks such as debugging, reverse engineering, and detailed file analysis. Key features include dual-mode viewing (hexadecimal and ASCII), direct binary data editing, and advanced navigation controls.</p>

                    <h3>Input Overlay</h3>
                    <p>Developed a C++ application that triggers a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) on a Windows system. This project demonstrates the use of NT API functions to simulate a critical system error, causing the operating system to crash and display a BSoD. The application is intended for educational purposes to showcase how critical system errors impact the OS.</p>

                    <h3>Master Boot Record (MBR) Virus</h3>
                    <p>This C++ program is a malicious tool designed to overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a system, potentially rendering the computer unbootable. In addition to the MBR overwrite, it creates various graphical and auditory disturbances on the desktop to disrupt the user experience. The program includes random color changes, graphical noise, and beeping sounds to cause confusion and frustration.</p>
