                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project involves creating a Hex Editor, a specialized tool designed for manipulating the fundamental binary data of files. The hex editor provides a direct interface for editing file contents in hexadecimal format, allowing users to have precise control over the binary data within files. This capability is particularly useful for low-level debugging and in-depth file analysis, enabling developers and power users to inspect and modify file structures at a granular level.</p>

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <p>The Hex Editor includes a hexadecimal view of file data, providing users with a clear representation of the binary content. Users can edit and save changes directly to the binary data, facilitating modifications in real-time. Additionally, the editor supports navigation through file data using keyboard shortcuts, streamlining the editing process and improving user experience.</p>

                <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                <p>The hex editor is implemented to handle binary data manipulation at a low level. It provides users with a clear view of the raw data contained within a file, allowing for precise modifications. The application supports a variety of navigation and editing functions, making it an essential tool for working with complex binary files and understanding their structure.</p>

                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>Hex editors are powerful tools that can be employed for debugging, reverse engineering, and educational purposes. However, it is crucial to use them responsibly and ethically. Ensure that any modifications made to files are done with proper authorization and for legitimate purposes, as unauthorized alterations can lead to legal and ethical implications.</p>
