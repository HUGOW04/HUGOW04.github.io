                        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project focuses on the creation of a Cheat Engine application that enables users to scan and manipulate a process's memory. 
                            By scanning the memory for specific values, the application allows users to locate and alter memory addresses corresponding to in-game 
                            values or other variables. The primary techniques employed include searching for specific values in memory, filtering those values, and 
                            writing new values to the identified memory addresses to achieve desired outcomes.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Code Explanation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The functionality of the Cheat Engine is implemented in C++. The core components of the application include various functions that handle memory 
                            scanning and manipulation. The <strong>search</strong> function scans the target process's memory for a specified value, logging the addresses 
                            where this value is located. The <strong>next</strong> function refines the list of addresses by filtering based on whether they contain the 
                            target value, ensuring that the most relevant addresses are retained. Finally, the <strong>write</strong> function enables users to modify the 
                            memory at the selected addresses by writing a new value, thereby allowing for customization of in-game parameters or other aspects of the 
                            software being targeted.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project employs C++ to facilitate direct interaction with process memory. It utilizes system-level programming techniques, including methods 
                            for reading and writing memory addresses. The implementation involves handling raw memory addresses and values, demonstrating the technical 
                            proficiency required to manipulate processes at a low level. By utilizing these techniques, the Cheat Engine provides a powerful tool for analyzing 
                            and modifying application behavior.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
                        <p>
                            While modifying process memory can be employed for legitimate purposes such as debugging or reverse engineering, it also carries the potential 
                            for misuse, particularly in gaming environments. Cheating can disrupt the integrity of games and lead to significant consequences for users, including 
                            bans or legal action. This project is intended strictly for educational purposes, emphasizing the importance of responsible use within legal and ethical 
                            boundaries. It is crucial for users to understand the implications of their actions when utilizing such tools.
