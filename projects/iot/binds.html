                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This project involves an automated blind system controlled via WiFi. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller 
                    in conjunction with a NEMA 23 stepper motor and a TB6600 driver. Initially, the motor's power was inadequate for 
                    moving the blinds, so I integrated a planetary gearbox to significantly enhance its torque and ensure reliable operation. 
                    Additionally, all necessary components were 3D printed to create a tailored mounting solution that fits seamlessly on my wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The automated blinds are programmed to operate based on a schedule determined by the time of day. During weekdays, 
                    the blinds open at 6 AM to allow natural light into the room, enhancing the morning atmosphere. Conversely, on weekends, 
                    the blinds are set to open later, at 9 AM, accommodating a more relaxed start to the day. In both scenarios, the blinds 
                    close at 10 PM, ensuring privacy and security during the night. The system connects to the local WiFi network and uses an 
                    NTP client to synchronize with accurate time, allowing it to adjust the blinds automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code employs EEPROM to retain the last known state of the blinds, ensuring that they resume their scheduled positions 
                    even after a power interruption. This functionality not only enhances user convenience but also adds an element of reliability 
                    to the automated system.
