                <h3>x86 Operating System</h3>
                <p>
                    This x86 operating system is crafted using Assembly language with a 16-bit boot mode. It transitions to a 32-bit mode for enhanced functionality and performance. 
                    The OS features integrated I/O operations allowing keyboard input, CPU management, and screen clearing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It includes custom memory management with a <code>malloc</code> implementation developed in C, without relying on external libraries. The system is built with both Assembly and C, showcasing my ability to develop low-level system software with custom libraries.
