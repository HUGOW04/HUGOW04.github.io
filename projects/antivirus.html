                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This version of the AntiVirus project is an improved version of my previous antivirus application. It is a cross-platform tool developed in C++ with OpenGL for rendering, ensuring compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The application efficiently detects and manages malware threats, offering file-specific and full system scanning features. Unlike the previous version, this iteration uses SHA-256 hashing instead of MD5, providing enhanced security through modern cryptographic methods.
                </p>

                <h2>Implemented Features</h2>
                <p>
                    The system currently supports signature scanning, real-time file system monitoring, heuristic detection, memory scanning for threats, autorun monitoring of startup apps and processes, system tray integration showing CPU and memory stats, a fully integrated graphical interface with OpenGL, and desktop notifications. Additionally, a neural network has been implemented to detect processes and malware that could not be found using hashes, greatly improving the system's ability to detect unknown threats.
                </p>

                <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
                <p>
                    Planned features include network scanning using WinAPI rules similar to Wireshark, detection of newly added files through Windows API hooks, phishing mail protection integrated with "Have I Been Pwned," scanning all new processes before execution with quarantine if suspicious, a full quarantine system to isolate or remove threats, sandbox execution for suspicious code, behavior analysis of programs, and expanded machine learning to detect unknown malware.
                </p>
