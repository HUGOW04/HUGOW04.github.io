                <h3>Mining Rig and Blockchain</h3>
                <p>
                    This project involved setting up a custom mining rig to mine cryptocurrency using my personal hardware. The mining rig was optimized for performance, and I developed a custom script to automate the transfer of mined coins to secure wallets. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I have maintained an active blockchain network, ensuring continuous operation and security. This project showcases my ability to manage and optimize cryptocurrency mining while integrating automation for efficient operations.
