                            This antivirus program is designed to detect malicious files by comparing their MD5 hashes 
                            against a database of known malware signatures. Users can input any file, including .exe and other 
                            file types, and the program will compute its MD5 hash. It then checks this hash against MD5 values 
                            retrieved from a server, such as MalwareBazaar. If the hash matches a known malware signature, 
                            the file is flagged as a virus; otherwise, it is deemed safe.

                            This ransomware project is a sophisticated piece of software capable of encrypting and decrypting 
                            the entire system. Upon execution, the ransomware initiates encryption routines that lock all files 
                            on the computer, making them inaccessible to the user. The encrypted files are then protected with 
                            a strong encryption algorithm. To regain access to their files, users must obtain the decryption key 
                            provided by the ransomware. The project demonstrates the power and potential dangers of ransomware, 
                            as well as the importance of robust cybersecurity measures.

                            failures, causing the operating system to stop functioning and display a blue screen with an error code. 
                            This disruption can lead to data loss and system instability, requiring a reboot or even a system restore.

                            Upon execution, ColorfulVirus initially changes the screen colors to a chaotic pattern, causing significant 
                            disruption to the user. If run with administrator rights, it further corrupts the Master Boot Record (MBR), 
                            leading to a fatal boot error on the next system startup, making Windows unable to locate the operating system.
